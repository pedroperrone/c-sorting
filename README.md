##  C-Sorting

The content in this repository was made to practice the use of C language and study the use of parallelism with it. It also serves to compare the results to the [same experiment using Elixir.](https://github.com/pedroperrone/elixir-sorting).

## How to run

Currently the main runs using a randomic list generated at runtime to test the functions performance. To run the project use `make` in your terminal and then `./sorting`. The optimization options are already in the `Makefile`. 

## TODO
* Implement mergesort algorithm;
* Implement parallelism in all sorting algorithms;
* Implement tests.
