##  C-Sorting

The content in this repository was made to practice the use of C language and study the use of parallelism with it. It also serves to compare the results to the [same experiment using Elixir.](https://github.com/pedroperrone/elixir-sorting).

## TODO
* Create a make file;
* Implement mergesort algorithm;
* Implement parallelism in all sorting algorithms;
* Implement tests.
